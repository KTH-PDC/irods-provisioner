# davrods-anonymous-vhost.conf

# Davrods is a mod_dav WebDAV provider. Configuration directives for
# Davrods should be placed in a <Location> block.

# Below we provide an example vhost configuration that enables Davrods
# in anonymous access mode. See the file 'davrods-vhost.conf' for a
# vhost configuration *with* authentication.

# Note that in order to use anonymous access, your iRODS permissions
# need to be set correctly as well:
# 1) Create the anonymous user if it doesn't yet exist (or use a
#    different user - see option DavRodsAnonymousLogin)
# 2) Grant read/write/own access to anonymous where appropriate
# 3) Point the DavRodsExposedRoot to a location where the anonymous
#    user has at least 'read' access.
