        # =================================

        # Disable built-in directory listings.
	DirectoryIndex disabled

	# Restrict access to authenticated users.
	AuthType Basic
        Require valid-user

        # The realm name that will be shown to clients upon authentication
        AuthName DAV

        # Use the 'irods' HTTP basic authentication provider, implemented by
        # davrods. This provider is used for setting up the iRODS connection,
        # and is therefore required for davrods to function.

        #
        # davrods implements multiple dav providers, use either:
        # - davrods-nolocks:                 WebDAV class 1 provider, no support for locking
        # - davrods-locallock (recommended): WebDAV class 2 provider, uses a DBM lock database local to this webserver
