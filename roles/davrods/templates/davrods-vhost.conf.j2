# davrods-vhost.conf
#
# davrods is a mod_dav WebDAV provider. Configuration directives for davrods
# should be placed in a <Location> block.
#
# Below we provide an example vhost configuration that enables davrods using
# its default options.

<VirtualHost *:{{ davrods_vhost_port }}>

    # Enter your server name here.
    ServerName {{ ansible_nodename }}

    # NB: Some webdav clients expect the server to implement webdav at the root
    # location (they execute an OPTIONS request to verify existence of webdav
    # protocol support).

    <Location />

        # Options needed to enable davrods.
        # =================================

        # Disable built-in directory listings.
	DirectoryIndex disabled

	# Restrict access to authenticated users.
	AuthType Basic
        Require valid-user

        # The realm name that will be shown to clients upon authentication
        AuthName DAV

        # Use the 'irods' HTTP basic authentication provider, implemented by
        # davrods. This provider is used for setting up the iRODS connection,
        # and is therefore required for davrods to function.
        AuthBasicProvider irods

        # The DAV provider for this location.
        #
        # davrods implements multiple dav providers, use either:
        # - davrods-nolocks:                 WebDAV class 1 provider, no support for locking
        # - davrods-locallock (recommended): WebDAV class 2 provider, uses a DBM lock database local to this webserver
        #
        Dav davrods-locallock

        # - 'User'      (collection /zone-name/home/logged-in-username)

        # NB: Please note that the use of temporary files may conflict with your iRODS
        # data policies (e.g. a acPostProcForPut would act upon the temporary filename).

    # To avoid cleartext password communication we strongly recommend to

    # For HTTPS-only access, change the port at the start of the vhost block
    # from 80 to 443 and add your SSL options below.
